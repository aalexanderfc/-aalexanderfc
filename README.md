### Hey! I'm Alexander üëã  
**Software Developer | Embedded & IoT Systems | Intern @ Acandia AB**

---

üîß I'm passionate about developing smart and secure IoT solutions using **Python**, **C/C++**, and open-source tools. From microcontrollers to dashboards ‚Äî I love connecting the dots and building end-to-end systems.

üß† I studied **Software Development for Embedded Systems and IoT** at **Nackademin ‚Äì Solna, Stockholm County**, where I specialized in real-world applications like sensor networks, secure communication, and device-to-cloud architectures.

üíº I'm currently doing my **internship at Acandia AB**, where I:
- Decode telemetry from **Ayyeka Wavelet** devices using **Protobuf**
- Visualize real-time sensor data in a **Modbus Dashboard**
- Use **ThingsBoard Server & Gateway** for scalable IoT integration
- Forward data securely to the **Ayyeka Cloud** using **MQTT over TLS**
- Design frontends with **HTML** and **CSS** for improved UX
